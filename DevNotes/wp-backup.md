This is an excellent and thorough manual backup procedure\! It covers the two essential components: **files** and **database**. ‚úÖ

Here is a regeneration of the response, maintaining the structure and content while offering the next logical step:

-----

## üíæ Manually Backing Up Your WordPress Site

This method is reliable, especially for **local development** and testing. It ensures you have copies of both your file system and your database.

### üóÇÔ∏è 1. Copy WordPress Files

Your WordPress files are typically located in the webroot directory: `/srv/http/wordpress`.

These files include:

  * **Core WordPress files**
  * **`wp-content` folder** (containing themes, plugins, and media uploads)
  * **`wp-config.php`** (containing crucial database connection information)

To create a dated backup:

```bash
cp -r /srv/http/wordpress ~/wordpress-backups/site-$(date +%F)
```

This command creates a complete file backup in your home directory, named like `~/wordpress-backups/site-2025-10-04`.

Or

```bash
tar -czvf wordpress-files-$(date +%F).tar.gz /srv/http/wordpress
```
This command creates a compressed file backup in your home directory, named like `~/wordpress-backups/site-2025-10-04.tar.gz`.

-----

### üóÑÔ∏è 2. Export the Database

Your site's dynamic content (posts, pages, settings, users, etc.) is stored in a MySQL database.

To back up the database:

```bash
mysqldump -u root -p wordpress > ~/wordpress-backups/db-$(date +%F).sql
```

**(Note:** Replace `wordpress` with your actual database name if it is different.)

-----

### ‚ôªÔ∏è 3. To Restore Later

If your site encounters issues or you need to migrate it, you can restore using these backups:

```bash
# Restore files
cp -r ~/wordpress-backups/site-YYYY-MM-DD /srv/http/wordpress

# Restore database
mysql -u root -p wordpress < ~/wordpress-backups/db-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
```

**(Remember** to substitute `YYYY-MM-DD` with the actual date of the backup you wish to restore.)

### üß† Tip: Automation

You can significantly improve this process by **automating** the file copying and database export with a simple **bash script** that runs daily or weekly via **cron**. This makes backups effortless and consistent.
