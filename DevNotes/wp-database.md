It sounds like you want to continue the installation process by creating the database WordPress needs. Here's a guide to creating the necessary database and user, assuming you are using a standard local server environment like **XAMPP**, **MAMP**, or a manually installed **LAMP/WAMP** stack.

-----

## Step-by-Step: Creating the WordPress Database

You will use a web interface called **phpMyAdmin**, which is included with most pre-built local server packages, to create and manage your database.

### 1\. Access phpMyAdmin

  * **Start your local server** (Apache/Nginx and MySQL/MariaDB services).
  * Open your web browser and navigate to the phpMyAdmin interface. This is typically one of the following addresses:
      * `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
      * `http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin`
      * If using MAMP, you'll usually find a "Tools" or "phpMyAdmin" link on the MAMP start page.

### 2\. Create the Database

Once inside phpMyAdmin:

1.  Click the **"New"** button in the left sidebar, or click the **"Databases"** tab at the top.
2.  In the "Create database" field, enter a name for your database. We'll use **`local_wordpress`** for this example.
3.  Select a **collation** (encoding) like **`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`** for best international support.
4.  Click the **"Create"** button.

The database is now created, but WordPress also needs credentials (a username and password) to access it.

### 3\. Create a Database User (Optional but Recommended)

For development, you can often use the default **`root`** user. However, creating a dedicated user is better practice:

1.  While in phpMyAdmin, click on the **`local_wordpress`** database you just created in the left sidebar.
2.  Click the **"Privileges"** tab at the top.
3.  Click **"Add user account"**.
4.  Fill in the details:
      * **User name:** Choose a name like **`wpuser`**.
      * **Host name:** Select **`Local`** or type **`localhost`**.
      * **Password:** Create a **strong password** and confirm it.
5.  Under "Database privileges," check the box that says **"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES"** on the database named **`local_wordpress`**.
6.  Click **"Go"** at the bottom right.

## 4\. Update the WordPress Configuration

After creating the database and user, you need to tell WordPress how to connect.

1.  Navigate to the folder where you placed your WordPress files (e.g., `/srv/http/wordpress`).
2.  Rename the file `wp-config-sample.php` to **`wp-config.php`**.
3.  Open **`wp-config.php`** in a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or Atom).
4.  Find the following lines and update the values with your database credentials:

<!-- end list -->

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'local_wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wpuser' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'YourStrongPasswordHere' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

5.  **Save and close** the `wp-config.php` file.

Now you can proceed to the final step: running the **web installation wizard** by visiting `http://localhost/your-wordpress-folder/` in your browser.
